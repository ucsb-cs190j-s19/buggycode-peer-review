1) Conceptual Question:
What is the difference between a reference and a pointer

Why can't the compiler find the header file utility.h?
g++ countEvens.cpp -o countEvens

2) Programming / Debugging Question:
How do I count the number of even numbers in in an array? 
More specifically, how do I go through each element in the array?
