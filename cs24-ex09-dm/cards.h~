// Use this file to define all your classes and public functions
// You should design your program with OOP prinicples using classes
// An example of class design would be having Card, CardList and Player as Classes.
// Card represent Node in your LinkedList which has some data in it
// CardList can be your LinkedList Class which has operations such as append, remove etc
// Player class represents your game player
// Think about the public functions that should be part of each class. (All public function need to be tested in unit testing)
// One of the important functions is search / find which is essential for players to find cars in their opponent's "hand"
// Make sure you overload the desired operators
// This is not the fixed design. We are not expecting exactly 3 classes. You can do with less or more.
// Important thing to consider is abstraction.
